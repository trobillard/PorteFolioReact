In fact since my first website under Joomla in 2012 (with CryoDiffusion) and my second website with Healcerion, I was really interested by changing my career and becoming a web developer/web designer. At that time I didn't have time to follow any course so when I had the opportunity I have registered right the way and started my 10 months training (8months in class and 2 months internship). The last time I enjoyed class was when I studied Korean language. I enjoyed this course and I am really proud to be on the way to become a web developer.",
